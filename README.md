# Two_Blind_Mice

This project is a collaborative exploration of reinforcement learning algorithms for spatial navigation.

# Prerequisites:
In order to run some of the programs in this repo, users will have to install [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) 
to optimize model training. 

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade gym`

It is also recommended that users install an updated version of Anaconda. Neural network programs will also require 
[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) :

`python3 -m pip install -U tensorflow`


# Project plan:

Below is a rough outline of our plan which we will ammend as we progress:

1) Create a set of naive policies to solve the Cart-Pole project. These naive policies will serve as a baseline for more optimized models using Artificial Neural networks.

2) Generate a set of RL models for finding optimal policies to win the Cart-Pole game. These models will help us explore concepts in reinforcement learning.

3) Create a maze runner model

4) Create an open world exploration agent

5) Do other cool things

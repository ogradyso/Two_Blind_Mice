# Two_Blind_Mice

This project is a collaborative exploration of reinforcement learning algorithms for spatial navigation.

# Prerequisites:
In order to run some of the programs in this repo, users will have to install Open AI Gym to optimize model training. It is also recommended that users install an updated version of Anaconda.

# Project plan:

Below is a rough outline of our plan which we will ammend as we progress:

1) Create a set of naive policies to solve the Cart-Pole project. These naive policies will serve as a baseline for more optimized models using Artificial Neural networks.

2) Generate a set of RL models for finding optimal policies to win the Cart-Pole game. These models will help us explore concepts in reinforcement learning.

3) Create a maze runner model

4) Create an open world exploration agent

5) Do other cool things
